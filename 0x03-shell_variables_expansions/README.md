## Shell; init files, variables and expansions.


**Introduction**

This project is part of my work in the alx SE foundations program and contains more shell scripts, specifically for initialization, expansions and variables.

These scripts can be added to $PATH  for easy execution and modified to automate frequently performed actions.

**Summary**

Feel free to take, use and modify these scripts for your personal work if they're helpful to you.

Thank you for stopping by.
